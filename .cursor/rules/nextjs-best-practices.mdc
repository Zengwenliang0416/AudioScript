- Favor server components for better performance and SEO
- Use the `use client` directive sparingly, only for client-side interactivity
- Implement proper error handling with `error.tsx` and `not-found.tsx`
- Use `generateStaticParams` for static generation of dynamic routes
- Optimize data fetching with `fetch` and caching strategies
